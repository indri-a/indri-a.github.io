I'm a master's student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) studying data science. Previously, I was a data scientist at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) working on tools to augment decision-making, from chip design to marketing. My background is originally in chemical engineering.

My interests include applying machine learning techniques to engineering and scientific problems, such as in manufacturing or [climate-related](https://disasterlab.berkeley.edu/people/) applications.

Outside of work you'll find me either sitting in the ocean trying to catch waves, playing board games, attempting 3-pointers, or climbing at the gym.

I love learning and trying new things so the previous list will change frequently.
